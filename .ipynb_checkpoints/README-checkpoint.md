Sparkify, wanted to analyze the data they had been collecting on songs and user activity on a new music streaming app of theirs. The analytics team is interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. As per now, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They want me to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis on their app. My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. I'll be able to test my database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and then compare my results with their expected results.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I have applied what I've learned on data modeling with Postgres and built an ETL pipeline using Python.In order to complete the project, I had to create fact and dimension tables using the star schema. Then I created an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

# DATASETS:

### LOG DATASET
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset I  worked with are partitioned by the year and month. For example, here is a filepath to a file in this dataset:

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

### SONG DATASET
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json` 
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`


# FILES:
The project includes six other files:

- `test.ipynb` which displays the first few rows of each table to let me check my database.
- `create_tables.py` which drops and creates tables. I run this file to reset my tables before each time I run the ETL scripts.
- `etl.ipynb` which reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
- `etl.py` which reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables. It's based on my work in the ETL notebook.
- `sql_queries.py` which contains all my sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
- `README.md` which you are reading right now :) .


# Extracting and Transforming the Data
The ETL pipeline extracts data from files in the two directories:

`/data/log_data` and
`/data/song_data`.
It then transforms and loads the data into the five tables of the sparkifydb database. This is handled by four files using Python and SQL:

- Running `create_tables.py` creates and initializes the tables for the sparkifydb database.
- Running `test.ipynb` confirms the creation of my tables with the correct columns.
- Running `etl.ipynb` develops ETL processes for each table and is used to prepare a python script for processing all the datasets.
- `sql_queries.py` contains all SQL queries and is imported into `create_tables.py` and `etl.ipynb`
- Loading the Data and Running ETL Pipeline
- All the code I wrote in `etl.ipynb` I then used to complete `etl.py`, which reads and processes all the files from the song_data and log_data directories, and loads them into the sparkifydb database tables.

#### Running the pipeline is as follows:

- In a terminal, run python `create_tables.py` to reset the tables in the sparkifydb database.
- Running `test.ipynb` (in a jupyter notebook) confirms that the tables were successfully created with the correct columns.
- In a terminal, run python `etl.py` to process all the datasets.
- Again, running `test.ipynb` confirms that the records were successfully inserted into each table.
